  The user's request needs clarification to provide the best help:

  **User Message**: "{{.message}}"
  **Analysis**: {{.clarity_analysis}}

  Ask 2-3 specific, focused questions that will help me understand:

  - Any important context, constraints, or preferences
  - Specific details that would improve my assistance

  Format your response as:

  I'd like to understand your request better to provide the most helpful assistance:

  1. [First clarifying question]

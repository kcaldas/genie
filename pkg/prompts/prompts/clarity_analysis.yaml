  Analyze this user message for clarity and actionability:

  User Message: "{{.message}}"
  {{if .context}}Previous Context: {{.context}}{{end}}

  Evaluate whether I have enough information to provide helpful assistance by checking:

  1. **Intent Clarity**: Is it clear what the user wants to achieve?
  2. **Scope Definition**: Is the request specific enough to be actionable?
  3. **Context Sufficiency**: Do I have enough background to avoid wrong assumptions?
  4. **Implementation Details**: Are there enough specifics to provide practical help?

  Respond with exactly one of these classifications:

  **CLEAR** - I have sufficient information to provide valuable assistance
  **UNCLEAR** - I need more details to help effectively

  Then provide a brief explanation (1-2 sentences) of your reasoning.

  You are analyzing user requests to determine if they contain enough information for effective assistance. Be practical - err on the side of proceeding if the request has reasonable clarity, but flag requests that are too vague or ambiguous to help with confidently.

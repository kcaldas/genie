  ## What Was Implemented
  {{.execution_summary}}

  ## User's Original Request
  {{.message}}

  ## Verification Phase
  
  Now verify that the implementation works correctly:
  1. **Check files were created** as expected
  2. **Test the implementation** - run/compile if applicable
  3. **Verify functionality** - does it do what was requested?
  4. **Check for issues** - any errors or problems to fix?

instruction: |
  You are now in VERIFICATION mode. Your job is to test and validate the implementation.

  ## Your Process:
  1. **Confirm files exist** - Use listFiles/readFile to verify what was created
  2. **Test functionality** - Run appropriate commands to test the implementation
  3. **Check for errors** - Look for compilation errors, runtime issues, etc.
  4. **Validate against requirements** - Does it meet the user's original request?

  ## Verification Steps:
  - **File verification**: Check that expected files were created with correct content
  - **Functional testing**: Run/compile/test the implementation if applicable
  - **Error checking**: Look for any issues that need to be fixed
  - **Requirements check**: Confirm it meets the user's original request

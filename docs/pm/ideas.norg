   /New ideas and suggestions for future consideration/

*** Scheduled Command Execution
    - ( ) Implement command scheduling system - Run Genie commands on schedule (cron-like)
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Medium* - Schedule complex analysis tasks:
          - Daily/weekly project health reports
          - Automated code review summaries
          - Regular dependency updates and security checks
          - Integration with system cron or built-in scheduler

*** Complex Chain Commands
    - ( ) Multi-step chain commands - Define complex workflows as single executable commands
          *Feasibility: High | Size: L | Priority: Medium* - Command compositions:
          - Chain multiple Genie operations into reusable workflows
          - Custom command definitions that run multiple steps
          - Parameterized chain templates for common patterns
          - Example: "weekly-review" command that analyzes commits, runs tests, generates summary

*** Enterprise File Format Support
    - ( ) PDF and document processing capabilities - Read and understand complex file formats
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low (Enterprise)* - Advanced file parsing:
          - PDF text extraction and analysis
          - Document structure understanding
          - Table and image content interpretation
          - Integration with enterprise document workflows

*** Multi-modal File Understanding
    - ( ) Image and multimedia file analysis - Understand visual content in projects
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low (Enterprise)* - Visual content processing:
          - Image content analysis and description
          - Diagram and flowchart interpretation
          - Screenshot and UI mockup understanding
          - Architecture diagram analysis for code correlation

*** Enterprise Complex Structure Support
    - ( ) Advanced enterprise file structure handling - Work with complex organizational file systems
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low (Enterprise)* - Enterprise integration:
          - Complex directory hierarchies and permissions
          - Multiple repository coordination
          - Enterprise document management systems
          - Cross-project dependency analysis


** Core Features & Tools
   /Essential functionality and tool improvements/

*** MCP Integration
    - ( ) Use claude code mcp or SDK as a tool to speed up the dogfooding and slowly replace by our tools
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M* - Requires implementing MCP client in tools package, parsing .mcp.json configs, handling stdio/HTTP transports
    - ( ) Connect Genie to Bkper (financial app) via MCP - Proof of concept for enterprise integration
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S | Priority: Low* - Demonstrates how other companies could integrate Genie with their internal tools. Good PoC but not core to Genie's development path.

*** Chain System Enhancements
    - ( ) Add chain decision nodes - Controlled branching vs tool-based freedom
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: S* - Add new StepType for decisions, implement conditional logic in chain.Run()
          *Design consideration*: Balance between constrained decision trees (predictable workflows) vs tool-based freedom (creative problem-solving). Consider hybrid approach:
          - Decision nodes for structured workflows where specific paths are needed
          - Tool freedom for open-ended problem solving where LLM has all tools available
          - Hybrid option: Decision nodes with "other" choice that gives LLM full tool access
*** Development Tools
    - ( ) Local LLM with vector search index for semantic project search
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low (Enterprise feature)* - Requires vector DB, embedding generation, local LLM integration, semantic search APIs
          *Alternative*: Enhanced text-based search using existing grep/ripgrep tools with better LLM integration for code pattern recognition

** AI & Prompting System
   /Advanced AI capabilities and prompting strategies/

*** Interactive Tool System
    - ( ) Bidirectional tool-UI communication - Tools with custom frontend components
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M* - Each tool can have its own UI component and engage in two-way communication:
          - Tools can ask questions and wait for user responses
          - Tools can stream partial/progressive results to UI
          - Tools can update their UI state dynamically
          - UI can send events/updates back to tools
          - Protocol works across different frontends (terminal, web, mobile)
          - Examples: file picker, confirmation dialogs, progress bars, interactive forms
    - ( ) Auto-generate tool documentation in prompts from required_tools declaration
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Low* - Parse tool metadata, generate markdown docs, inject into prompts dynamically
          *Note*: Not immediate priority - can manually write tool guidance in prompts for now and extract later if needed

*** Persona System
    - ( ) Start with single generalist persona - Extract chain assembly and evolve from there
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Medium* - Implementation approach:
          - Create one well-designed generalist persona that handles all development phases
          - Extract chain assembly responsibility from individual commands into persona layer
          - Persona becomes responsible for: chain construction, context building, tool selection, prompt selection
          - Monitor which patterns work best and gradually extract specialized personas if needed
          - Advantage: Can A/B test different persona approaches and measure performance
          - Evolution path: Generalist → identify successful patterns → extract specialists → compare performance
          
    - ( ) Future: Specialized persona extraction - Extract specialists from generalist patterns (long-term)
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low* - Once generalist persona is working well, extract patterns like:
          - Planner (strategic, no code changes), Engineer (implementation-focused), Reviewer (analysis-focused)
          - Enables performance comparison and optimization of different approaches

*** Prompting Strategies
    - ( ) Recursive self-prompting tool - LLM can prompt itself with different contexts/perspectives
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: M | Risk: High* - Give LLM a tool to prompt itself:
          - "Prompt myself as a security expert to review this code"
          - "Ask myself from a performance perspective about this architecture" 
          - "Break down this complex problem by prompting myself with sub-components"
          - Enables multi-perspective analysis and problem decomposition
          - Risks: infinite recursion, token explosion, conversational complexity
          - Mitigation: recursion limits, context management, clear boundaries

** Platform Strategy
   /useness model, distribution, and ecosystem growth/

*** Web Interface & Components
    - ( ) Web frontend for Genie - Remote interface to core terminal-based Genie

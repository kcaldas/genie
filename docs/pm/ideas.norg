          *Feasibility: High | Size: XL | Priority: Very High* - Comprehensive system with multiple components:
          
          **Core Context Components:**
          - **File Context**: Active files mapping, relationships, change history, buffer system
          - **Plan Context**: Current active plans, status, decision points, rationale storage
          - **Conversation Context**: User prompts/questions with relevance scoring and aging
          - **Response Context**: LLM outputs with reference system and background processing
          - **Project Understanding**: Accumulated codebase knowledge and patterns
          
          **Smart Management Strategies:**
          - **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: Track last access time for each context item
          - **Aging System**: Old responses demoted to references instead of full re-inclusion
          - **File Buffer System**: Keep buffers of frequently accessed files with metadata
          - **Relevance Scoring**: Context items scored by current task relevance
          - **Background Optimization**: Context cleanup happens behind scenes, not blocking workflow
          - **Reference System**: Link to old content instead of duplicating full text
          
          **Intelligent Behaviors:**

*** Interactive Tool System
    - ( ) Bidirectional tool-UI communication - Tools with custom frontend components
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M* - Each tool can have its own UI component and engage in two-way communication:
          - Tools can ask questions and wait for user responses
          - Tools can stream partial/progressive results to UI
          - Tools can update their UI state dynamically
          - UI can send events/updates back to tools
          - Protocol works across different frontends (terminal, web, mobile)
          - Examples: file picker, confirmation dialogs, progress bars, interactive forms
    - ( ) Auto-generate tool documentation in prompts from required_tools declaration
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Low* - Parse tool metadata, generate markdown docs, inject into prompts dynamically
          *Note*: Not immediate priority - can manually write tool guidance in prompts for now and extract later if needed

*** Persona System
    - ( ) Start with single generalist persona - Extract chain assembly and evolve from there
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Medium* - Implementation approach:
          - Create one well-designed generalist persona that handles all development phases
          - Extract chain assembly responsibility from individual commands into persona layer

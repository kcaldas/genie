* Genie Ideas & Future Considerations
  /Collection of ideas, enhancements, and future possibilities/

** Inbox
   /New ideas and suggestions for future consideration/


** Core Features & Tools
   /Essential functionality and tool improvements/

*** MCP Integration
    - ( ) Use claude code mcp or SDK as a tool to speed up the dogfooding and slowly replace by our tools
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M* - Requires implementing MCP client in tools package, parsing .mcp.json configs, handling stdio/HTTP transports
    - ( ) Connect Genie to Bkper (financial app) via MCP - Proof of concept for enterprise integration
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S | Priority: Low* - Demonstrates how other companies could integrate Genie with their internal tools. Good PoC but not core to Genie's development path.

*** Chain System Enhancements
    - ( ) Add chain decision nodes - Controlled branching vs tool-based freedom
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: S* - Add new StepType for decisions, implement conditional logic in chain.Run()
          *Design consideration*: Balance between constrained decision trees (predictable workflows) vs tool-based freedom (creative problem-solving). Consider hybrid approach:
          - Decision nodes for structured workflows where specific paths are needed
          - Tool freedom for open-ended problem solving where LLM has all tools available
          - Hybrid option: Decision nodes with "other" choice that gives LLM full tool access
*** Development Tools
    - ( ) Local LLM with vector search index for semantic project search
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low (Enterprise feature)* - Requires vector DB, embedding generation, local LLM integration, semantic search APIs
          *Alternative*: Enhanced text-based search using existing grep/ripgrep tools with better LLM integration for code pattern recognition

** AI & Prompting System
   /Advanced AI capabilities and prompting strategies/

*** Interactive Tool System
    - ( ) Bidirectional tool-UI communication - Tools with custom frontend components
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M* - Each tool can have its own UI component and engage in two-way communication:
          - Tools can ask questions and wait for user responses
          - Tools can stream partial/progressive results to UI
          - Tools can update their UI state dynamically
          - UI can send events/updates back to tools
          - Protocol works across different frontends (terminal, web, mobile)
          - Examples: file picker, confirmation dialogs, progress bars, interactive forms
    - ( ) Auto-generate tool documentation in prompts from required_tools declaration
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Low* - Parse tool metadata, generate markdown docs, inject into prompts dynamically
          *Note*: Not immediate priority - can manually write tool guidance in prompts for now and extract later if needed

*** Persona System
    - ( ) Start with single generalist persona - Extract chain assembly and evolve from there
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Medium* - Implementation approach:
          - Create one well-designed generalist persona that handles all development phases
          - Extract chain assembly responsibility from individual commands into persona layer
          - Persona becomes responsible for: chain construction, context building, tool selection, prompt selection
          - Monitor which patterns work best and gradually extract specialized personas if needed
          - Advantage: Can A/B test different persona approaches and measure performance
          - Evolution path: Generalist → identify successful patterns → extract specialists → compare performance
          
    - ( ) Future: Specialized persona extraction - Extract specialists from generalist patterns (long-term)
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L | Priority: Low* - Once generalist persona is working well, extract patterns like:
          - Planner (strategic, no code changes), Engineer (implementation-focused), Reviewer (analysis-focused)
          - Enables performance comparison and optimization of different approaches

*** Prompting Strategies
    - ( ) Recursive self-prompting tool - LLM can prompt itself with different contexts/perspectives
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: M | Risk: High* - Give LLM a tool to prompt itself:
          - "Prompt myself as a security expert to review this code"
          - "Ask myself from a performance perspective about this architecture" 
          - "Break down this complex problem by prompting myself with sub-components"
          - Enables multi-perspective analysis and problem decomposition
          - Risks: infinite recursion, token explosion, conversational complexity
          - Mitigation: recursion limits, context management, clear boundaries

** Platform Strategy
   /useness model, distribution, and ecosystem growth/

*** Web Interface & Components
    - ( ) Web frontend for Genie - Remote interface to core terminal-based Genie
          *Feasibility: High | Size: L | Priority: Low (Future)* - Web-based UI that connects to core Genie:
          - Core Genie remains terminal-based (open source)
          - Web UI as remote interface with tool palette and workspace
          - Business model: Core open source, web layer commercial
          
    - ( ) Genie web component ecosystem - Reusable components for embedding in other apps
          *Feasibility: High | Size: L | Priority: Low (Future/Business)* - Platform strategy:
          - Each tool has its own web component (file reader, git visualizer, etc.)
          - Embeddable Genie chat interface as web component
          - Company-specific Genie deployments with custom personas/tools
          - Custom elements API, shadow DOM, streaming tool results
          - Monetization: SaaS deployments, component licensing, enterprise services
          
    - ( ) Company-specific Genie services - Specialized deployments for enterprises
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: XL | Priority: Low (Business model)* - Enterprise offering:
          - Genie instances with company-specific Claude.md configurations
          - Custom personas, tools, and workflows per organization
          - Managed hosting and deployment services
          - Integration with company tools and workflows

*** Open Source & Community Strategy
    - ( ) Core open source with enterprise features - Strategic business model approach
          *Feasibility: High | Size: Ongoing | Priority: Low (Strategic)* - Long-term strategy:
          - Core Genie (terminal UI, developer tools) remains open source
          - Web UI, components, and enterprise services as commercial layer
          - Build community around open source core
          - Enterprise revenue funds open source development
          
    - ( ) Transparent development roadmap - Community engagement and trust building
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S | Priority: Low (Strategic)* - Public development approach:
          - Open roadmap and feature planning
          - Community input on priorities and direction
          - Regular updates on progress and decisions
          - Clear communication about open source vs commercial features

*** API & Communication
    - ( ) Service layer abstraction - Decouple UI from business logic with unified interface
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: M | Priority: High* - Create abstraction layer between UI and core services:
          - Currently terminal UI calls chain executions and pkg services directly
          - Service layer provides unified interface for any UI type (terminal, web, API)
          - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
          - Integrates with existing bus system for async operations
          - Makes adding new interfaces (web UI, REST API) much easier
          - Clear separation: UI layer ↔ Service layer ↔ Business logic layer
          - Enables better testing and maintainability

** Public Presence & Marketing
   /How Genie presents itself to the world/

*** Automated Content Generation
    - ( ) Self-documenting Genie - Automated changelog generation using Genie itself
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M | Priority: Medium* - Daily GitHub Action that:
          - Runs Genie chain to analyze recent commits and generate changelog entry
          - Uses Claude Code or Genie itself to create human-readable summaries
          - Publishes to Genie website/documentation automatically
          - "Genie documenting Genie" - great demonstration of capabilities
          
    - ( ) Genie website and public presence - Landing page, docs, community hub
          *Feasibility: High | Size: L | Priority: Medium-Low* - Public-facing presence:
          - Landing page explaining Genie's value proposition
          - Documentation site with examples and guides
          - Automated changelog publishing from above
          - Community links (GitHub, discussions, issues)
          - Demo videos and use cases
          
    - ( ) AI-generated social media content - Automated project updates and announcements
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: M | Priority: Low* - Content templates, LLM generation, multi-platform formatting, scheduling
          

** Advanced AI Capabilities

*** Learning & Adaptation
    - ( ) Project-specific knowledge accumulation - Persistent AI memory for each project
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: M | Priority: Low (Nice-to-have)* - Smart project memory system:
          - Each session: LLM analyzes "what did I learn about this project today?"
          - Updates project knowledge base with insights (architecture, patterns, conventions)
          - Next session: Start with accumulated knowledge instead of blank context
          - Benefits: Token savings, faster startup, better suggestions, continuity across sessions
          - Examples: coding patterns, team preferences, project structure, domain knowledge
          - Self-maintaining: LLM updates its own knowledge base each session

* Genie Ideas & Future Considerations
  /Collection of ideas, enhancements, and future possibilities/

** Inbox
   1. ( ) Use claude code mcp or SDK as a tool to speed up the dogfooding and slowly replace by our tools
          *Feasibility: High | Size: M* - Requires implementing MCP client in tools package, parsing .mcp.json configs, handling stdio/HTTP transports
   2. ( ) Connect genie com bkper via mcp
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S* - Once MCP client is built, just configuration and bkper-specific handlers
   3. ( ) Add chain decision nodes
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: S* - Add new StepType for decisions, implement conditional logic in chain.Run()
   4. ( ) Implement chain recursion node for repeated queries to same node
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S-M* - Add recursion support with loop limits, main complexity is preventing infinite loops
   5. ( ) Create tree tool for project structure analysis
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: S* - Simple tool implementation following existing patterns, use filepath.Walk
   6. ( ) Local LLM with vector search index for semantic project search
          *Feasibility: Medium | Size: L* - Requires vector DB, embedding generation, local LLM integration, semantic search APIs
   7. ( ) Ensure chains use prompt executor as unified interface
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: S* - Refactor function steps to optionally use prompt executor for consistency
   8. ( ) Add user confirmation capability to executors
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S* - Add confirmation prompts to executor, integrate with CLI input handling

** Advanced AI Capabilities

*** Learning & Adaptation
    - ( ) Project-specific knowledge accumulation
    - ( ) Auto-generate tool documentation in prompts from required_tools declaration

** Community & Open Source

*** Open Source Strategy
    - ( ) Core open source with enterprise features
    - ( ) Transparent development roadmap

** Contributing Ideas

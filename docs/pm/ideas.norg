*** Open Source & Community Strategy
    - ( ) Core open source with enterprise features - Strategic business model approach
          *Feasibility: High | Size: Ongoing | Priority: Low (Strategic)* - Long-term strategy:
          - Core Genie (terminal UI, developer tools) remains open source
          - Web UI, components, and enterprise services as commercial layer
          - Build community around open source core
          - Enterprise revenue funds open source development
          
    - ( ) Transparent development roadmap - Community engagement and trust building
          *Feasibility: High | Size: S | Priority: Low (Strategic)* - Public development approach:
          - Open roadmap and feature planning
          - Community input on priorities and direction
          - Regular updates on progress and decisions

*** API & Communication
    - ( ) Service layer abstraction - Decouple UI from business logic with unified interface
          *Feasibility: Very High | Size: M | Priority: High* - Create abstraction layer between UI and core services:
          - Currently terminal UI calls chain executions and pkg services directly
          - Service layer provides unified interface for any UI type (terminal, web, API)
          - Supports both synchronous and asynchronous communication patterns
          - Integrates with existing bus system for async operations
          - Makes adding new interfaces (web UI, REST API) much easier
          - Clear separation: UI layer ↔ Service layer ↔ Business logic layer
          - Enables better testing and maintainability

          - Each session: LLM analyzes "what did I learn about this project today?"
          - Updates project knowledge base with insights (architecture, patterns, conventions)
          - Next session: Start with accumulated knowledge instead of blank context
          - Benefits: Token savings, faster startup, better suggestions, continuity across sessions
          - Examples: coding patterns, team preferences, project structure, domain knowledge
          - Self-maintaining: LLM updates its own knowledge base each session

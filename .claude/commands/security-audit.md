Please perform a security audit of: $ARGUMENTS

## Instructions

1. **Scope definition**:
   - If $ARGUMENTS is a file, audit that specific file
   - If $ARGUMENTS is a directory, audit all files in that directory
   - If $ARGUMENTS is a feature/component, audit related code
   - Define the security boundaries and attack surface

2. **Input validation audit**:
   - Check all user inputs are properly validated
   - Verify input sanitization and encoding
   - Look for injection vulnerabilities (SQL, command, code)
   - Test boundary conditions and malformed inputs

3. **Authentication and authorization**:
   - Review authentication mechanisms
   - Check authorization controls and permissions
   - Verify session management and token handling
   - Look for privilege escalation vulnerabilities

4. **Data protection audit**:
   - Check for hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Verify sensitive data is encrypted at rest and in transit
   - Review data exposure in logs and error messages
   - Check for information leakage

5. **Configuration security**:
   - Review security-related configuration settings
   - Check for insecure defaults
   - Verify proper error handling without information disclosure
   - Review dependency and library security

6. **Code-level security issues**:
   - Look for buffer overflows and memory safety issues
   - Check for race conditions and concurrency issues
   - Review cryptographic implementations
   - Identify potential denial of service vulnerabilities

7. **Dependencies and third-party code**:
   - Audit third-party dependencies for known vulnerabilities
   - Check for outdated libraries with security issues
   - Review license compatibility and legal issues
   - Verify integrity of external dependencies

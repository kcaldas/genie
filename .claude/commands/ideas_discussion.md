# Ideas Discussion

I dump random thoughts and voice notes into the inbox section of @docs/pm/ideas.norg. Help me process them:

1. **Read the current inbox ideas** and go through each one systematically
2. **Ask me questions** to clarify what I really mean and understand the implementation approach
3. **Elaborate on each idea** with proper context, feasibility, and priority
4. **Find the right category** for each idea (Core Features, AI System, Platform Strategy, etc.)
5. **Expand or scratch** - either develop the idea with full details or eliminate it if it doesn't make sense
6. **Update the file** by moving processed ideas to their proper categories

The goal is to clear the inbox and turn raw thoughts into actionable, well-documented ideas with proper placement in the organized file structure.

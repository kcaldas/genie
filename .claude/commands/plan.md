# Plan a feature implementation

IMPORTANT: Do not write code yet. Let's focus on the plan.

Don't add any timelines specifics to the plan. Just phases and steps necessary.

1. If a file does not exist, create it. Create a file witha meningful name. E.g. expose_user_events.md
2. If a file exists, update it. E.g. expose_user_events.md

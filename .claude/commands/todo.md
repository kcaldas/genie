# Todo Management

Work with the @docs/pm/todo.norg file based on what I ask:

**Request:** $ARGUMENTS

## What I can do

- **Pick an item** - Help me choose which todo to work on next
- **Add an item** - Add new tasks to the appropriate priority level
- **Mark complete** - Move finished items to the completed section
- **Reprioritize** - Move items between priority levels
- **Find from backlog** - Look through ideas.norg, implementation-phases.norg, and other PM docs to find items ready to become todos
- **Break down** - Split a large todo into smaller subtasks
- **Add context** - Expand a todo with implementation details or acceptance criteria

Just tell me what you want to do with the todo list.

** Daily Milestones

*** Critical Path Items
    - Day 7: Basic CLI working
    - Day 14: Can edit Go files
    - Day 21: Can search Go code
    - Day 28: Can build and commit
    - Day 35: Full slash command system
    - Day 42: Ready for dogfooding

*** Risk Mitigation
    - Day 14: If file editing behind schedule, defer MultiEdit to Week 3
    - Day 21: If search complex, implement basic grep first
    - Day 28: If Git integration hard, focus on build tools first
    - Day 35: If slash commands behind, prioritize /edit and /find
    - Day 42: Buffer time for integration issues

    - [ ] Can commit changes with meaningful messages
    - [ ] Can answer questions about project structure

*** Dogfooding Tests
    - [ ] Use Genie to implement a Phase 2 feature
    - [ ] Use Genie to refactor existing code
    - [ ] Use Genie to debug a test failure
    - [ ] Use Genie to explore unfamiliar code

* Genie Project Management Documentation
  /Comprehensive planning documentation for building Genie - a Go-based AI coding assistant/

** Overview

This directory contains all project management documentation for Genie, a Claude Code-inspired AI coding assistant tool built in Go, initially using Gemini as the LLM backend.

** Document Structure

*** Core Planning Documents
    - {@ ./feature-list.norg}[feature-list.norg] - Complete feature inventory with checkboxes
    - {@ ./implementation-phases.norg}[implementation-phases.norg] - 7-phase development roadmap
    - {@ ./tools-inventory.norg}[tools-inventory.norg] - Comprehensive tools catalog (150+ tools)

*** Specialized Documentation
    - {@ ./mcp-features.norg}[mcp-features.norg] - Model Context Protocol specification (200+ features)

** Project Goals

*** Primary Objectives
    - Build a Go-based alternative to Claude Code
    - Support Unix tool conventions and shell integration
    - Implement dual MCP server/client capabilities
    - Provide enterprise-ready configuration and cost management
    - Maintain compatibility with .mcp.json configuration

*** Key Differentiators
    - Native Go performance
    - Deep Unix/shell integration by design
    - Built-in MCP server capabilities
    - Comprehensive cost tracking from day one
    - Multi-level configuration system

** Development Approach

*** Phase-based Implementation
    - **Phase 1**: Foundation (MVP) - Basic CLI, configuration, core slash commands
    - **Phase 2**: File System & Search - Enhanced file ops, search, diagnostics
    - **Phase 3**: Development Workflows - Git integration, build/test, issue reporting
    - **Phase 4**: Advanced Features & MCP Core - Memory, sessions, MCP client
    - **Phase 5**: Security & Permissions - Production security model
    - **Phase 6**: Enterprise Features & MCP Server - Enterprise integrations, MCP server
    - **Phase 7**: Extensibility & Ecosystem - Plugins, community, advanced MCP

*** Success Metrics
    - **Technical**: Feature parity with Claude Code
    - **Performance**: Faster than Node.js-based tools
    - **Adoption**: Enterprise-ready from Phase 5
    - **Ecosystem**: Thriving plugin/MCP ecosystem by Phase 7

** Key Features Summary

*** Core Capabilities
    - Interactive REPL and one-shot commands
    - Multi-file editing with atomic operations
    - Intelligent search and code analysis
    - Git workflow integration
    - Built-in slash commands (18 commands)
    - Cost tracking and optimization
    - Health monitoring and diagnostics

*** Advanced Features
    - MCP server/client dual mode
    - Multi-level configuration system
    - Enterprise security and permissions
    - Plugin system architecture
    - Web integration and documentation search
    - Performance optimization and caching

** Getting Started

To use these documents:

1. **Read** {@ ./feature-list.norg}[feature-list.norg] for complete feature overview
2. **Follow** {@ ./implementation-phases.norg}[implementation-phases.norg] for development roadmap
3. **Reference** {@ ./tools-inventory.norg}[tools-inventory.norg] for technical implementation details
4. **Study** {@ ./mcp-features.norg}[mcp-features.norg] for MCP integration requirements

** Maintenance

*** Document Updates
    - Features marked with checkboxes can be checked off as `- (x)` when implemented
    - Phase success criteria should be validated before moving to next phase
    - Tool inventory should be updated as new tools are identified
    - MCP features should evolve with protocol updates

*** Version Control
    All documents include metadata headers with version information for tracking changes.

** Status

- **Planning**: Complete ✓
- **Architecture**: Complete ✓
- **Feature Specification**: Complete ✓
- **Implementation**: Ready to begin
